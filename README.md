# ControlLineCompanion
##Aplicacion para android que permite configurar el vuelo para aviones RC y generar estadisticas y datos Ãºtiles

##TODO Features

###Configure or detect sensors.
  - RPM
  - Battery
  - Gyro (for G forces && detect if is ascending or descending)
  - Compass ( for calculating orientation and laps per second/speed)
  - Amperimeter
  - airspeed
  
  
###Configure a flight:
  -Flight mode: manual operation or preconfigured time.
  -Security options configuration
  -throttle.
  -automated stop, maybe control parameters such as battery level, to stop flight and avoid battery damage.
  -automated throttle, watch sensors to adjust throttle in function of several parameters ( constant rpm, constant thrust, battery level, amps)

###Security options:
  -Security stop with phone button, push a button on phone to stop.
  -Constant link with phone, for security reasons (If link is bronken, you couldnt manually stop the motor, so cut motor throttle).

###Record a flight:
  -use installed sensors if available to record a flight and then virtually replay a flight.
  -Compare flight trajectory with an ideal flight path to check performance.
  -Possibility of detecting acrobatic maneuvers and puntuate by difficulty and performance

###Flight analysis:
  -With recording flights check performance improvements
  -Store sensed data as RPM, battery levels during flight, amperage and show a chart.
  
###Model configuration.
  -Store all previous configurations by model.
  -allow use camera to store a photo of the model.

###Other tools:
  -Given a cable length measure speed counting laps with a phone button or tactile button.
  -Crash wall of fame. (self explanatory). Possibility of share.
